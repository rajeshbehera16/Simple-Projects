# JavaScript Conditional Statements Exercises

This repository contains exercises for practicing JavaScript conditional statements. The exercises are organized into six categories, each focusing on different aspects of conditional logic in JavaScript.

## Categories

### Category 1: if...else Statements
- Check if a number is even or odd
- Check voting eligibility based on age
- Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Identify vowels and consonants
- Compare two numbers and find the greater one

### Category 2: if...else if...else Statements
- Grade students based on marks
- Determine the day of the week from a number
- Check if a year is a leap year
- Provide weather suggestions based on temperature

### Category 3: Comparison Operators (==, ===)
- Compare values using both loose (==) and strict (===) equality
- Compare string '5' and number 5
- Implement a login check with strict equality

### Category 4: Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
- Check driving eligibility (age and license)
- Determine if a number is divisible by 2 OR 3
- Toggle boolean values with the NOT operator
- Check discount eligibility for students OR seniors

### Category 5: Ternary Operator
- Check if a number is even or odd using the ternary operator
- Determine pass/fail status based on marks
- Check leap years using the ternary operator

### Category 6: prompt(), confirm(), alert()
- Check if a number is positive or negative using user input
- Confirm before deleting a record
- Display a welcome message based on user name
- Check voting eligibility based on user input
- Create a simple login simulation

## How to Run

### Node.js (Categories 1-5)
You can run the first five categories directly with Node.js:

```bash
node category1.js
node category2.js
node category3.js
node category4.js
node category5.js
```

### Browser (All Categories)
For all categories, especially Category 6 which uses browser-specific functions:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. Click on the buttons to run the different exercises
3. For Categories 1-5, check the browser console (F12) to see the results
4. For Category 6, interact with the dialog boxes that appear

## Notes

- Category 6 exercises use `prompt()`, `confirm()`, and `alert()` which are only available in browser environments, not in Node.js.
- The exercises are designed to be educational and demonstrate different ways of using conditional statements in JavaScript.
- Each exercise includes example usage to help understand how the functions work.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply if...else statements
- Use if...else if...else for multiple conditions
- Compare values using == and === operators
- Apply logical operators (&&, ||, !) in conditions
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditionals
- Interact with users using browser dialog functions
